# `cd` (as an external command)

A small command-line program for running
a program in a given directory (folder).

# Why?

It nicely fills the gaps where the `cd` builtin of your shell cannot
reach, and where invoking a new shell or other interpreter would be
needlessly verbose and inconvenient - for example right after `sudo`.
